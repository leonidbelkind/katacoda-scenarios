# Playbooks with Multiple Steps

In this scenario you will learn how to create a playbook with multiple steps and how to pass values from the output of one step to the arguments of another step. The pattern is automating manual steps of taking an output of something (a CLI command, a Query inside a Log Viewer) and using it to perform the following operation.

Playbooks are declarative pipelines automating a set of operations that should otherwise be performed by engineers. They are either built in a [**Visual Planner**](https://app.stackpulse.io/playbook/create) provided by StackPulse or edited via any IDE of your choice.

In this tutorial we will use **Microsoft Visual Studio Code** to show how to develop playbooks and __StackPulse CLI__ for uploading playbooks and executing them.
